# DHCP Workflow Learning Prompt
# Interactive guide for understanding and implementing DHCP services

## Welcome to DHCP Mastery! üöÄ

This interactive workflow will guide you through understanding and configuring DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) from basic concepts to advanced enterprise deployments.

## Phase 1: Understanding DHCP Fundamentals üìö

### What You'll Learn:
- How DHCP automates IP address assignment
- The DORA process (Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge)
- DHCP server components and configuration
- Lease management and renewal processes

### Interactive Questions to Get Started:

1. **Scenario Setup**: You're the network administrator for a growing company with 150 employees. Currently, everyone manually configures their IP addresses, leading to conflicts and management headaches.

   PROMPT: "Describe three problems you might encounter with manual IP configuration and explain how DHCP would solve each one."

   Expected Learning Points:
   - IP address conflicts
   - Configuration errors
   - Administrative overhead
   - Lack of centralized control

2. **DHCP Benefits Analysis**: 
   PROMPT: "List 5 benefits of implementing DHCP in your network. For each benefit, provide a real-world example of how it improves network operations."

## Phase 2: Hands-On DHCP Configuration üõ†Ô∏è

### Lab Exercise 1: Basic DHCP Pool Setup

**Scenario**: Configure DHCP for the main office network (192.168.1.0/24)

**Your Task**: 
1. Open the DHCP Demo page in the application
2. Configure a DHCP pool with these requirements:
   - Network: 192.168.1.0/24
   - Pool range: 192.168.1.100 - 192.168.1.200
   - Gateway: 192.168.1.1
   - DNS servers: 8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1
   - Lease time: 24 hours

**Interactive Prompts**:

PROMPT: "Before configuring, calculate: How many IP addresses will be available in your DHCP pool? Show your work."

PROMPT: "Why might you choose 192.168.1.100-200 as your pool range instead of 192.168.1.2-254? What are the advantages of reserving the lower addresses?"

PROMPT: "Configure the pool now. What happens when you click 'Configure Pool'? Describe the feedback you receive."

### Lab Exercise 2: Device Connection Simulation

**Your Task**: Connect 5 different device types to your DHCP network

**Interactive Prompts**:

PROMPT: "Add these devices one by one and observe the DORA process simulation:
- A laptop (Sales department)  
- A printer (Office equipment)
- A smartphone (Executive)
- An IoT sensor (Facilities)
- A server (IT department)

For each device, record:
- MAC address generated
- IP address assigned
- Lease expiration time
- Any special considerations"

PROMPT: "Which device should you consider giving a DHCP reservation to and why? Implement this reservation."

### Lab Exercise 3: Pool Utilization Testing

**Your Task**: Test what happens when your DHCP pool approaches capacity

**Interactive Prompts**:

PROMPT: "Add devices until your pool utilization reaches 80%. What warnings or alerts should a production network implement at this point?"

PROMPT: "Continue adding devices until the pool is exhausted. Describe what happens to new device requests. How would you handle this situation in a real network?"

PROMPT: "Release 3 IP addresses and add new devices. Observe how the system reuses released addresses."

## Phase 3: Advanced DHCP Features üéØ

### Lab Exercise 4: DHCP Reservations Management

**Scenario**: Your network has critical devices that need consistent IP addresses

**Interactive Prompts**:

PROMPT: "Create reservations for these critical devices:
- Mail server (needs 192.168.1.10)
- Main printer (needs 192.168.1.11)  
- Network scanner (needs 192.168.1.12)

Document the MAC addresses used and explain why reservations are better than static IP configuration for these devices."

PROMPT: "Test the reservation system by requesting IP addresses for the reserved MAC addresses. Verify they receive their designated IPs."

### Lab Exercise 5: Multiple Network Scenarios

**Your Task**: Configure DHCP for different network types

**Scenario A: Guest Network**
- Network: 172.16.100.0/24
- Short lease times (2 hours)
- Limited pool size
- Basic DNS only

**Scenario B: Voice Network** 
- Network: 192.168.10.0/24
- Specific DHCP options for VoIP
- Longer lease times
- QoS considerations

**Interactive Prompts**:

PROMPT: "Configure the guest network first. Why would you use shorter lease times? What security considerations apply to guest networks?"

PROMPT: "Now configure the voice network. Research what special DHCP options VoIP phones typically need (Option 66 for TFTP server, etc.). How would these be implemented?"

PROMPT: "Compare the utilization patterns between your main office, guest, and voice networks. What different monitoring approaches might each require?"

## Phase 4: DHCP Troubleshooting üîß

### Lab Exercise 6: Common DHCP Issues

**Scenario**: Users are reporting network connectivity problems

3. **Incorrect DHCP Options**:
   - Configure incorrect DNS servers (use 192.168.1.999)
   - What symptoms would users experience?
   - How would you troubleshoot this?"

PROMPT: "Create a 'DHCP Health Check' procedure. List 10 things you would check when users report 'network problems' that might be DHCP-related."

### Lab Exercise 7: Performance Analysis

**Your Task**: Analyze DHCP server performance and efficiency

**Interactive Prompts**:
